# TTP-FHIR Gateway Implementation Guide

Description files and examples for the simplifier project "https://simplifier.net/ths-greifswald".
                                                         
## IMPORTANT - This IG has moved. No longer maintained at this location.
This Implementation Guide was maintained on simplifier from 2021 until October 2025.
Due to organisational and technical issues a switch from simplifier to IG Publisher was performed in October 2025.
The IGs for E-PIX, gICS, gPAS, Dispatcher and necessary Terminology were separated within the process.

The latest compiled versions of the **new implementation** guides will be online available from **November 2025** from here: http://ths-greifswald.de/fhir
